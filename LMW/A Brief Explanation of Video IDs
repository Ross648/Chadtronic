A Video ID is a string of eleven characters automatically assigned to every YouTube video when they are uploaded to identify the video. The Video ID on any given video cannot be changed. They are usually found after a "watch?v=" such as in this URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTGUSVf5Gto

Sometimes, however, they can just be after a "/" such as in this YouTube URL used when using the Share function on a video:
https://youtu.be/qTGUSVf5Gto

Other less common variants exist. Usually Video IDs can be found easily from the URL.



Video IDs are very important for finding information about videos, and even the videos themselves. They can be used to find the videos':

YouTube Page (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXX)

Thumbnails (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XXXXXXXXXXX/maxresdefault.jpg) (https://i1.ytimg.com/vi/XXXXXXXXXXX/maxresdefault.jpg)

Storyboards (https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://i.ytimg.com/sb/_qIfYVQnYmc*) (Example of a Wayback Machine list of URLs with the prefix of "https://i.ytimg.com/sb/_qIfYVQnYmc" with a wildcard at the end of the URL. "qIfYVQnYmc" is the Video ID in this example)

Video Files (https://web.archive.org/web/0oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/XXXXXXXXXXX (for oldest video index) https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/XXXXXXXXXXX (for newest video index))

etc..
